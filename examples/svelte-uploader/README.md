# Svelte File Uploader with Uploadcare Blocks

[![Edit svelte-uploader](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/uploadcare/blocks-examples/tree/main/examples/svelte-uploader/)

This is an example project of implementing a file uploader in a Svelte application with [Uploadcare Blocks](https://github.com/uploadcare/blocks).

## Run this demo locally

```bash
# clone this repo and go to the cloned folder

$ cd examples/svelte-uploader

$ npm install
# or `yarn install`, if you wish

$ npm run start
# or `yarn start`
```

## Installation

All you need to do is to install [`@uploadcare/blocks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uploadcare/blocks) from npm
via your favorite Node package manager.

The package provides TypeScript types, so you do not need to install `@types/anything` if you need a proper typing.

[Read more about installation](https://uploadcare.com/docs/file-uploader/installation/) in the Uploadcare documentation.

## Configuration

Please, read the [File Uploader documentation](https://uploadcare.com/docs/file-uploader/).

## Integration notes

Blocks are native to the Web, which makes them native to Svelte too.

E.g. in this example we created a [FileUploader](src/lib/FileUploader/FileUploader.svelte) component
which provides Svelte-friendly API for the rest of the view. There are Blocks inside of this component and nowhere else.

### Styling

If your styling solution may provide class string or style object, feel free to use them on blocks like
`lr-file-uploader-regular` and override default class using CSS variables.

Otherwise you may go “full override” way and pass a string with styles to a File Uploader type of your choice.

[Read more about styling](https://uploadcare.com/docs/file-uploader/styling/) in the File Uploader docs.
