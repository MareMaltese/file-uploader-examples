# Uploadcare File Uploader Examples

This repository provides examples of integrating the [Uploadcare File Uploader](https://github.com/uploadcare/file-uploader) into various environments and frameworks.

Our File Uploader is built using Web Components, which makes it **framework-agnostic**. That means you can integrate it into any project, whether working with React, Vue, Angular, or a plain JavaScript setup. The examples aim to help you implement the uploader into any workflows and use cases, regardless of the specific tech stack.

* [JavaScript](./examples/js-uploader/)
* [React](./examples/react-uploader/)
* [Angular](./examples/angular-uploader/)
* [Vue](./examples/vue-uploader/)
* [Svelte](./examples/svelte-uploader/)
* [Next.js](./examples/next-uploader/)

We’re always looking to improve and find the best solutions. That’s why we created the [React wrapper](https://github.com/uploadcare/react-components/blob/main/packages/react-uploader/README.md)—to support familiar development patterns and approaches:

* [React via Adapter](./examples/react-uploader-adapter/)
* [Next.js via Adapter](./examples/next-uploader-adapter/)

## Lack an example?

If you need help with your stack or have a specific question or use case, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/uploadcare/file-uploader-examples/issues). We’re here to explore more integrations and help you out.
